# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of several fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to build a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood by avoiding the use of high-level machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following machine learning algorithms are implemented from scratch:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
6. **K-Means Clustering**
7. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

Each algorithm is implemented using core Python libraries like `numpy` and `matplotlib` for basic operations and visualization, without relying on high-level machine learning frameworks.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
